This is a for-fun project I made to test some of the capabilities of CSS vars and skeuomorphism.

The whole JS is just a toggle for a CSS var and a body class.

## Install
First, you will need to install it. Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder and write the following command to install the dependencies.
 
```
npm install
```

I used Webpack to bundle and process the SCSS, also to be able to write some ES6+. Sure, it was not a requirement but none of this project was! 

## Running
To run the project you just need to run

```
npm start
```
And if everything works out as expected you can now open http://localhost:8080 to modify, clone, or anything you want to do with it.
